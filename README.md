# Face_Landmark_Link

Using the Google Mediapipe, Face_Landmarker.py process, I am extracting normalized blendshape data from video. The script writes normalized Blendshape scores into a csv., a similar file than what Unreal Live Link is outputting.
It can be used to generate facial motion capture in 3d software, for example Blender, especially with the FACE-It plugin.
